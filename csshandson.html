    <p class="p1">What is CSS ? </p>
    <ol class="ol">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed </li>
        <li><span class="s1">CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="s2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>
        <li class="l4"> External Stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="p1">CSS can be added to document in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file </li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="s2"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p2"> When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elments ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p2">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
